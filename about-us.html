      <div>
        <p class="flow-text">
          TigerDev is Auburn’s Video Game Development club. TigerDev was founded in 2015 with the goal
          to provide a community atmosphere focused around breaking down the barrier between technical skill and your
          imagination.

        <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">What Do We Do?</h3>
        <ul class="flow-text" style="text-align: left;line-height: 1.5em;">
          <li>Every week we meet to show off our recent work, discuss design philosophy / technique, or to discuss our
            game of the month (similar to a book club).</li>
          <li>Every semester we form interdisciplinary teams that come together to create fully working games over the
            course of the semester.</li>
          <li>Multiple times a semester we come together for Game Jams. If you don’t know, game jams are events (like
            “hackathons”) in which you develop a brand new game during the length of the jam (usually 48 hours). At the
            beginning of the jam we meet somewhere for the unveiling of the theme and to form groups.
            At which point you are welcome to stick around and work on your game or go off on your own. We generally have
            reserved classrooms and free food available for all participants!</li>
        </ul>

          <div>Harper Rhett is an aspiring game designer and programmer, born and raised in
            Atlanta, Georgia. From his engineering roots in high school robotics, to someday hoping to join the game
            development industry, Harper can often be found creating things. Some examples may be participating in game
            jams, leading some sort of development project, and working with creators from around the world. In the few
            moments when he's not creating games however, Harper enjoys ultimate frisbee, going to the theaters, and
            hiking.
