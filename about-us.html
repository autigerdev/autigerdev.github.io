    <h1 style="font-weight: bold;" id="who-we-are">What is TigerDev?</h1>
    <div>
      <p class="flow-text">
        TigerDev is Auburn’s Video Game Development club. TigerDev was founded in 2015 with the goal
        to provide a community atmosphere focused around breaking down the barrier between technical skill and your
        imagination.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">What Do We Do?</h2>
      <ul class="flow-text" style="text-align: left;line-height: 1.5em;">
        <li>Every week we meet to show off our recent work, discuss design philosophy / technique, or to discuss our
          game of the month (similar to a book club).</li>
        <li>Every semester we form interdisciplinary teams that come together to create fully working games over the
          course of the semester.</li>
        <li>Multiple times a semester we come together for Game Jams. If you don’t know, game jams are events (like
          “hackathons”) in which you develop a brand new game during the length of the jam (usually 48 hours). At the
          beginning of the jam we meet somewhere for the unveiling of the theme and to form groups.
          At which point you are welcome to stick around and work on your game or go off on your own. We generally have
          reserved classrooms and free food available for all participants!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Where Do We Meet?</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">Meetings Monday @6:00PM on Zoom and in-person, check our <a href="https://discord.gg/46zzXxbyFs">Discord</a> for details.</p>
