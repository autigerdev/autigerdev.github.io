                    <i class="flow-text">"I currently work as a Production Assistant on Fortnite at Epic Games. I joined TigerDev when I was a junior in college after dreaming of making games in my free time. What I found was an active, passionate community of students like me. I still hold that TigerDev was the most valuable experience I had in college, and leading/working on a project taught me more about game development than anything else. The experience and connections I made there opened doors that I wouldn't have had otherwise." - Fall 2021</i>

                    <i class="flow-text">"I'm currently an Associate UI Scripter at Bethesda Games Studio and have gotten to work on Fallout 76. When I was in TigerDev I got to be a part of the Homeland team and be a project lead for Throne Wars and Gaia. TigerDev taught me a lot and I got to experience different aspects of game development from art, design, and programming to collaborating and scoping. TigerDev definitely helped me achieve my dreams." - Spring 2021</i>
