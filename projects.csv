The game must be compiled with the g++ compiler using the makefile within the root directory. Any attempts to compile this software on anything other than Linux will be met with all sorts of mean, nasty looks and possible silent treatment. Once running the game press �p� to start the game or �e� to exit. The player can be controlled with the �a� and �d� key. Avoid the seizure-inducing cubes to raise your score."
