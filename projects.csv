The idea was to take a 3D Mario open world and reimagine it with the movement mechanics of Mirrors Edge. The objective is to make a demo in which we showcase the movement mechanics, how they play into the design of the world, and an original hip hop score to tie it together. Hip Hopper features wall jumping, wall climbing, and wall running in an interconnected world."
