fall2018 tweet game-jam,nextgen.png,Next Gen,Rice Shelley,https://rootiedev.itch.io/next-gen,,"NextGen is a proof of concept game for 3d rendering (and flaunting some cool Linear Algebra) in an ASCII terminal. The core functionality of the rendering engine has been written from scratch over the course of 3 days in C++. It makes use of the sdl_mixer library for playing audio, it is important to note that this component of NextGen is only part of the demo game and not required as a core part of the 3d rendering software. The game must be compiled with the g++ compiler using the makefile within the root directory. Any attempts to compile this software on anything other than Linux will be met with all sorts of mean, nasty looks and possible silent treatment. Once running the game press “p” to start the game or “e” to exit. The player can be controlled with the “a” and “d” key. Avoid the seizure-inducing cubes to raise your score."
