giphy.gif,Gaia,Team Gaia: Led by Keola Silva,,,"Gaia is a 2D side-scrolling platforming game in a 3D world inspired by Paper Mario. You play as Gaia, a creature capable of transforming into different forms that give him different abilities. Gaia can gain the ability to transform into other forms once he collects enough crystal shards of each type: green shards to become the forest ranger, red shards to become the desert wanderer, and blue shards to become the arctic bear. Your goal is to help Gaia add these abilities to his arsenal so he can defeat the final boss, Fenrir."
HipHopper.gif,HipHopper,Team Hopper: Led by Christian Graham,,https://christiangraham.org/#/hip-hopper/,"Hip Hopper is a first person platformer inspired by mascot platformers of the N64/PS1/PS2 era. The idea was to take a 3D Mario open world and reimagine it with the movement mechanics of Mirror’s Edge. The objective is to make a demo in which we showcase the movement mechanics, how they play into the design of the world, and an original hip hop score to tie it together. Hip Hopper features wall jumping, wall climbing, and wall running in an interconnected world."
